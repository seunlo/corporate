            <p>
              Elaloey Foundry is a social enterprise and venture fund for
              startup ideas and early-stage businesses in Nigeria. It is
              earmarked for spotting, nurturing, and funding talents, innovative
              ideas, and startup businesses with potential to transform Nigeria.
              We provide young, credible, and innovative entrepreneurs with the
              requisite business coaching, corporate services, and funding to
              launch and scale their ideas and startups for the greater good of
              Nigeria.

            <h3 className="font-bold text-3xl text center my-3">The problem</h3>
            <p>
              Nigeria boasts of the finest minds and active population in Africa
              and the world by extension. With about 70% of its population being
              young people (156 million), Nigeria is blessed with economic asset
              â€“ a talented and active workforce with the capacity for GDP growth
              and economic development. Sadly, a sizeable portion of these
              talents are not harnessed and the business ideas and startups from
              this active population die prematurely due to lack of economic
              support and infrastructure to launch and thrive.
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-bold text-3xl text center my-3">Our mission</h3>
            <p>
              We exist to provide the required oxygen for business ideas and
              startups to launch and thrive. By so doing, we are building the
              next big thing in Nigeria!
